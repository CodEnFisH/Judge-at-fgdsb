### Features

Judge@fgdsb is a desktop app to help you learn algorithms and practice real interview coding questions.

The app will call the local compilers or virtual machines to compile, run and judge your solutions.

We do support C++, Java, Ruby, Python and Lua. Scala supporting is on going!

### Releases

[Download](https://github.com/wangyanxing/fgdsb_judge/releases).

### Build and run

Judge@fgdsb was developed based on [Node-webkit](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/tree/master).

Copy all Node-webkit files to the root folder, run ```npm install``` to install node modules and bowers. 

Then you can just open the node-webkit app. Enjoy it!
